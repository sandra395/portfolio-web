## 📁 What Files Should I Edit?

### ✏️ Files You'll Edit Often (Your Content)

These files have **lots of helpful comments** explaining what to change:

| File | What It Contains |
|------|------------------|
| `data/personal-info.ts` | Your name, job title, bio, email, location |
| `data/contact-links.ts` | Your email and social media links |
| `data/projects.ts` | Your portfolio projects |
| `data/experiences.ts` | Your work experience |
| `data/tech-stack.ts` | Technologies you know |

**Look for comments like:** `// ← CHANGE THIS`

---

### 🎨 Files You Might Edit (Styling)

These files have **detailed comments** explaining every Tailwind class:

| File | What It Contains |
|------|------------------|
| `components/sections/ContactSection.tsx` | Contact section (now with beginner-friendly comments!) |

**Other section files** (HeroSection, AboutSection, etc.) can be edited the same way, but ContactSection has the most detailed comments as an example.

---

### 🚫 Files You Probably Won't Edit

Don't worry about these unless you're comfortable with coding:

- `components/ui/*` - Pre-built UI components
- `app/*` - Next.js configuration
- `lib/*` - Utility functions
- `types/*` - TypeScript types

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Open your project folder** in VS Code (or your favorite code editor)

2. **Open these files:**
   - `data/personal-info.ts`
   - `data/contact-links.ts`

3. **Change your information:**
   - Look for `// ← CHANGE THIS` comments
   - Edit your name, email, social links

4. **Save the files** (Cmd+S or Ctrl+S)

5. **See your changes:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open: http://localhost:3000

**Done!** 🎉

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### ✅ Do This:
- Make **one change at a time**
- **Save often** (Cmd+S or Ctrl+S)
- **Refresh your browser** to see changes
- **Read the comments** in the files
- **Copy existing code** and modify it
- **Keep backups** before big changes

### ❌ Avoid This:
- Changing multiple files at once
- Deleting code you don't understand
- Forgetting commas `,` in lists
- Forgetting quotes `"` around text
- Editing files in `components/ui/`

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If Something Breaks:
1. **Check the Terminal** - It shows error messages
2. **Undo your last change** - Cmd+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows)
3. **Look for common mistakes:**
   - Missing comma `,`
   - Missing quote `"`
   - Wrong file path
4. **Read the error message** - It often tells you what's wrong

### Common Errors:

**"Cannot find module"**
- You might have a typo in a file path
- Check image paths start with `/images/`

**"Unexpected token"**
- You're missing a comma `,` or quote `"`
- Check your last change
