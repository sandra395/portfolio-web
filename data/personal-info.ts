  bio: `I'm a frontend developer who combines technical skills with a unique background in education and design. I completed a JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp at Northcoders, where I built a full-stack property booking platform like Airbnb using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I've also enhanced my skills through courses with Code First Girls and continue building projects independently.

My teaching experience has equipped me with strong problem-solving and communication skills that I now apply to writing clean, efficient code and collaborating effectively with development teams. I'm currently volunteering with a Women in Coding community, helping others while continuing to expand my own technical expertise.

I'm passionate about creating accessible, user-focused web applications and am seeking a Frontend or Full-Stack Developer role where I can contribute to meaningful projects while growing alongside experienced developers.`,
